Making Delicious Chili

FOR THE PICKLED ONIONS:

1  lime
1  red onion or shallot, thinly sliced
 Large pinch of kosher salt
 Small pinch of granulated sugar

FOR THE CHILI:

 Olive or grapeseed oil
1  large onion, chopped
3  garlic cloves, or to taste, minced
1  teaspoon chile powder, plus more to taste
1  teaspoon dried oregano, plus more to taste
2  (15-ounce) cans beans, drained
1  (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes with their juices
 Kosher salt
 Fresh cilantro, diced avocado and sour cream, for garnish (optional)

PREPARATION

Make the pickled onions: Squeeze lime juice into a bowl, and add onion, salt and sugar. Let rest while you make the chili.
Prepare the chili: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add the oil. When hot, add onion and sauté until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, chile powder and oregano and sauté until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add beans and tomatoes and a few large pinches of salt and let simmer until the tomatoes break down, about 20 minutes.
Taste and add more salt, chile powder and/or oregano to taste. Serve with the pickled onions and any of the garnishes you like.
