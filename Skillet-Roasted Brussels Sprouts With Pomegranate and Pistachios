https://github.com/Tigray11/IT100-Recipe-/blob/main/Skillet-Roasted%20Brussels%20Sprouts%20With%20Pomegranate%20and%20Pistachios

Ingredients:

1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon table salt
1/4 cup shelled pistachios, toasted and chopped fine
2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds

Instructions:

Arrange the brussels sprouts in a single layer cut sides down in a 12-inch 
nonstick skillet and drizzle oil evenly over them. 
Cover skillet, place over medium-high heat, and cook until brussels sprouts are bright green 
and cut sides have started to brown, about 5 minutes.
Uncover and continue to cook until cut sides of brussels sprouts are deeply and evenly browned 
and a paring knife meets little to no resistance, 2 to 3 minutes, adjusting heat and moving brussels sprouts 
as needed to prevent overbrowning.

Off heat, add pomegranate molasses and cumin to skillet and stir to evenly coat the brussels sprouts. 
Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a platter and sprinkle with pistachios and pomegranate seeds, and serve.
